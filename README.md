# House Flipper Color Randomizer
A single page that randomizes paint colors used in the game House Flipper.

# About this Project
I find House Flipper to be a relaxing game and some members of the r/houseflipper subreddit were posting their tips on changing up what paint colors they use in game. So I decided to grab all the paint colors from the game and make a page that would allow you to randomly get different sets of colors. As I hadn't coded anything in a while this took longer than expected. Obviously, I rally enjoyed making the UI and less enjoyed figuring out the script. I'd like to say that it's because at this point I'm more familiar with Python but actually I was just extremely rusty. Less rusty now though!
