# House Flipper Color Randomizer
A single page that randomizes paint colors used in the game House Flipper.

# About this project
I find House Flipper to be a relaxing game and some members of the r/houseflipper subreddit were posting their tips on changing up what paint colors they use in game. So I decided to grab all the paint colors from the game and make a page that would allow you to randomly get different sets of colors.
